-- Running React Website with NGINX Locally on MAC OSX

  I followed this website: https://www.sylvaindurand.org/setting-up-a-nginx-web-server-on-macos/

    Installed Homebrew
    Installed NGINX - got installed at: /usr/local/etc/nginx

    To start NGINX, run: sudo brew services restart nginx

    I updated nginx.conf as follows:

        Command: diff nginx.conf nginx.conf.default
        Output:
            < #user  christopher.aguirre;
            ---
            > #user  nobody;
            44c44
            <             root   /Users/christopher.aguirre/dev/git/spotlight/build;
            ---
            >             root   html;

    To restart nginx after conf changes: sudo brew services restart nginx

    To stop nginx: sudo brew services stop nginx

      or try: nginx -s stop


    **Note: Be careful with these commands, excessive use of 'sudo' can lead to mistakes which mess up your machine!! **
